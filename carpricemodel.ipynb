    "# Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a regression-based machine learning model that accurately predicts the market price of used cars based on their technical specifications and usage history.\n",
    "This system helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair price for a vehicle and understand the key factors influencing car value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains historical records of used cars along with their features and selling prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tBrand: Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Honda)\n",
    "\t•\tModel: Specific model name of the car\n",
    "\t•\tYear: Year of manufacture\n",

    "\t•\tVisualize correlations to identify features with the strongest influence on price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\t•\tEncode categorical variables such as Brand, Fuel Type, Transmission, and Location using:\n",
    "\t•\tLabel Encoding or\n",
    "\t•\tOne-Hot Encoding (preferred for non-ordinal features)\n",
    "\t•\tHandle skewed variables using transformations if necessary.\n",
    "\t•\tRemove or cap extreme outliers where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Scaling\n",
    "\t•\tApply feature scaling to numerical variables such as Mileage, Engine Size, and Year.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train-Test Split\n",
    "\t•\tSplit the dataset into training and testing sets:\n",
    "\t•\tTraining set: 70–80%\n",
    "\t•\tTesting set: 20–30%\n",
    "\t•\tUse a fixed random state for reproducibility.\n",
